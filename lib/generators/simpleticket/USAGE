Description:
    SimpleTicket is a super-minimal issue tracker that you can add to your 
    application in order to allow users to raise bug reports and feature 
    requests quickly and painlessly.

Example:
    rails generate simpleticket

    This will create:
        app/controllers/issues_controller.rb
		app/models/issue.rb
		app/views/issues/edit.html.erb
		app/views/issues/index.html.erb
		app/views/issues/new.html.erb
		app/views/issues/show.html.erb
		db/migrations/TIMESTAMP_create_issues.rb
